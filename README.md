# Simple-Arduino-Controller-VB2012
Here's my very simple app arduino SERIAL data reader and controller written in c# especially uses visual studio 2012 
=================================================================
I had attach two sensors to my nano LM35 and MQ135 to read air data then write it onto serial communication then 
received by the program also I set listener on nano which can translate code ab or whatever those come from vb program
to turning on or off led
